//  Again, this will log the window as well, because this checks it's lexical scope, then global and sees who is the owner of the function
// it is the window so it logs the window.


const element = document.querySelector("button");

element.addEventListener('click', () => {console.log(this)});
// I changed the code just to check
//  Because it is an arrow function, this doesn't get assigned a value on how it is called or invoked,
// but according to the owner of the function it is written it. AddEvent listener is part of the window object,
// so it will log the window
